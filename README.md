## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the basics of Tailwind CSS by doing this project. I only use their cdn, so no dynamic options are included. I used flexbox and grid by following [Tailwind Css Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/). This was fun and I love this framework.

### Continued Development

I really enjoy [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) just for their utility first workflow. For that reason, I have most control on my code and design process. It is more fun than [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - My go to site, if I get stucked.
